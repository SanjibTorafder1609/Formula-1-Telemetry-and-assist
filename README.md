# Formula-1-Telemetry-and-assist
This project analyzes and visualizes telemetry data from F1 2021 gameplay and compares it with real-world Formula 1 race data using the OpenF1 API. The goal is to help players understand where they’re losing time on track—whether through braking too early, inconsistent throttle, or slower sector performance.
